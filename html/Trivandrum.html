                    must surely have Parasuraman been a “must see” destination for ages, long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. 
                    Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam 
                    to west Kerala, God's own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of 
                    this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit.
                    It doesnt take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers 
                    and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly, countless others from the pages of history,
                    recorded or not.</p>
